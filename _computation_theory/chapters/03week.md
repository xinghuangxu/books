## Context-Free Grammars
* context free grammars (most common description for these languages)
* Definition of these grammars and the way that these grammars define languages which is through "derivations"
* Related Notation *Backus-Naur Form*
* Two most important application of CFG: processing natural languages and computer languages

## CFG Formalism
* Terminals  = symbols of the alphabet of the language being defined.
* Variables   = nonterminals  = a finite set of other symbols, each of which represents a language.
* Start symbol  = the variable whose language is the one being defined.
* Productions

## CFG Productions
* A production  has the form variable (head) -> string of variables and terminals (body).
* Conventions:
  * A, B, C,...  and also S are variables.
  * a, b, c,... are terminals.
