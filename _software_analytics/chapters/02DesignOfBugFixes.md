title: The Design Space of Bug Fixes and How Developers Navigate It
---

### The first systematic characterization of the design of bug fixes.
* A study of the Pex4Fun game that motivates our work
* A replication of our original survey of Microsoft developers with an additional 37 developers from other companies.
* Additional vignettes of the design dimensions and design navigation choices drawn from the original interviews.
* Findings about why developers avoid refactoring how they decide which analysis methods to use to determine bug frequencies,
 and who decides on which bug fix design to implement, drawn from our original survey.
 
### This paper seeks to understand in what way bug fixes differ and why one fix is chosen over another.

### Motivation
* The diversity of Pex4Fun solutions alludes to the diversity that may exist in bug fixes.

### Methodology
* opportunistic interviews
* firehouse interviews
* Triage meeting observations
